# Progress Report

## Frontend Setup

### July 22, 2025

- **Objective:** Set up the frontend development environment to run inside a Docker container and initialize on startup.
- **Initial Setup:**
    - Created a `Dockerfile` for the frontend application (`frontend/Dockerfile`).
    - Updated `docker-compose.yml` to include a `frontend` service, connecting it to the existing `auth` service.
- **Troubleshooting & Resolution:**
    - Encountered a persistent `TypeError: crypto.hash is not a function` error when starting the Vite development server within the container.
    - **Attempt 1:** Changed the base Docker image from `node:18-alpine` to `node:18`. The error persisted.
    - **Attempt 2:** Modified `vite.config.js` to explicitly set the server host to `0.0.0.0`. The error persisted.
    - **Attempt 3:** Modified the `dev` script in `package.json` to include `--force --host` flags. The error persisted.
    - **Resolution:** Upgraded the Node.js version in the `frontend/Dockerfile` from `node:18` to `node:20`. This resolved the incompatibility issue with Vite.
- **Current Status:**
    - The frontend application now successfully starts and runs within its Docker container.
    - The development environment is accessible at `http://localhost:5173`.
