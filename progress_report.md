# Progress Report

## Frontend Setup

### July 22, 2025

- **Objective:** Set up the frontend development environment to run inside a Docker container and initialize on startup.
- **Initial Setup:**
    - Created a `Dockerfile` for the frontend application (`frontend/Dockerfile`).
    - Updated `docker-compose.yml` to include a `frontend` service, connecting it to the existing `auth` service.
- **Troubleshooting & Resolution:**
    - Encountered a persistent `TypeError: crypto.hash is not a function` error when starting the Vite development server within the container.
    - **Attempt 1:** Changed the base Docker image from `node:18-alpine` to `node:18`. The error persisted.
    - **Attempt 2:** Modified `vite.config.js` to explicitly set the server host to `0.0.0.0`. The error persisted.
    - **Attempt 3:** Modified the `dev` script in `package.json` to include `--force --host` flags. The error persisted.
    - **Resolution:** Upgraded the Node.js version in the `frontend/Dockerfile` from `node:18` to `node:20`. This resolved the incompatibility issue with Vite.
- **Current Status:**
    - The frontend application now successfully starts and runs within its Docker container.
    - The development environment is accessible at `http://localhost:5173`.

## Vulnerability Fix and Gitignore Update

### July 22, 2025

- **Objective:** Address reported security vulnerabilities and manage untracked files.
- **Vulnerability Fix:**
    - Identified a critical vulnerability in the `form-data` package via `npm audit`.
    - Resolved the vulnerability by running `npm audit fix`, which updated `package-lock.json`.
- **Gitignore Update:**
    - Added `.DS_Store` to the `.gitignore` file to prevent it from being tracked by Git.
- **Current Status:**
    - All identified vulnerabilities have been resolved.
    - The `.DS_Store` file is now correctly ignored by Git.

## Frontend Refactoring and API Integration

### July 22, 2025

- **Objective:** Refactor the existing frontend to align with the new design system and integrate with the API using a more robust approach.
- **Key Changes:**
    - **Design System Foundation:** Created `frontend/src/index.css` to establish global styles (color palette, typography, basic resets) and imported it into `frontend/src/main.jsx`.
    - **API Integration Layer:**
        - Refactored `frontend/src/utils/api.js` into `frontend/src/utils/apiClient.js` to centralize API calls, handle `Bearer` token authorization, and implement automatic `accessToken` refreshing using `refreshToken` and `sessionId`.
        - Created `frontend/src/utils/useApi.js` as a custom React hook to provide a convenient and consistent way for components to interact with the `apiClient`, leveraging `AuthContext` for token management.
    - **Authentication Context:** Updated `frontend/src/context/AuthContext.jsx` to store and manage `refreshToken` and `sessionId` in `localStorage` alongside `accessToken`.
    - **Core Authentication Pages Refactoring:**
        - **Signup (`frontend/src/pages/Signup.jsx`):** Updated to use `useApi`, implement client-side validation, and display messages/errors with new styling.
        - **Login (`frontend/src/pages/Login.jsx`):** Updated to use `useApi`, implement client-side validation, and display messages/errors with new styling.
        - **Verify Email (`frontend/src/pages/VerifyEmail.jsx`):** Updated to use `useApi`, pre-populate fields from navigation state, implement validation, and display messages/errors.
        - **Forgot Password (`frontend/src/pages/ForgotPassword.jsx`):** Updated to use `useApi`, implement validation, and display messages/errors.
        - **Reset Password with Token (`frontend/src/pages/ResetPasswordWithToken.jsx`):** Updated to use `useApi`, extract token from URL, implement validation, and display messages/errors.
        - **Resend Verification Email (`frontend/src/pages/ResendVerificationEmail.jsx`):** Updated to use `useApi`, implement validation, and display messages/errors.
    - **Protected Routes and User Pages Refactoring:**
        - **Logout (`frontend/src/pages/Logout.jsx`):** Updated to use `useApi` for API call, handle loading states, and display messages/errors.
        - **Profile (`frontend/src/pages/Profile.jsx`):** Updated to use `useApi` to fetch and display user profile data, handle loading/error states, and provide a link to update profile.
        - **Update Profile (`frontend/src/pages/UpdateProfile.jsx`):** Updated to use `useApi`, pre-fill form with current data, implement validation, and handle messages/errors.
        - **Login History (`frontend/src/pages/LoginHistory.jsx`):** Updated to use `useApi` to fetch and display login history in a structured table, handle loading/error states.
        - **Active Sessions (`frontend/src/pages/ActiveSessions.jsx`):** Refactored to use `useApi` to fetch and display active sessions, with functionality to revoke individual sessions.
        - **Reset Password (`frontend/src/pages/ResetPassword.jsx`):** Refactored to use `useApi`, implement validation, and handle messages/errors.
    - **Dashboard Implementation:** Refactored `frontend/src/pages/Home.jsx` to serve as a dashboard, conditionally displaying navigation links based on authentication status.
    - **Token Management Debugging:** Added `console.log` statements to `frontend/src/context/AuthContext.jsx` and `frontend/src/utils/apiClient.js` to trace token storage and refresh processes. Resolved issue where `accessToken` was not being sent with immediate requests after login by ensuring `apiClient` reads tokens directly from `localStorage`.
- **Current Status:**
    - All core authentication flows and user-related pages have been refactored to adhere to the new design system and utilize the centralized API integration.
    - The application's frontend is now more robust, maintainable, and visually consistent.
    - Token expiration issues have been resolved.

## Backend Fix for Active Sessions

### July 22, 2025

- **Objective:** Correct the `GET /sessions` endpoint to return only the active sessions for the authenticated user.
- **Key Changes:**
    - Modified `src/services/AuthService.js` to correct the query in `getActiveSessions` from `userId._id` to `userId`, ensuring sessions are filtered by the authenticated user's ID.
- **Current Status:**
    - The `getActiveSessions` function in the backend now correctly filters sessions by user ID.

## Unified Navigation and Layout

### July 22, 2025

- **Objective:** Implement a unified navigation bar and footer for consistent application layout and improved user experience.
- **Key Changes:**
    - **Navbar Component:** Created `frontend/src/components/Navbar.jsx` to provide conditional navigation links based on authentication status.
    - **Footer Component:** Created `frontend/src/components/Footer.jsx` for consistent application footer.
    - **Global Styling:** Added basic styling for `Navbar` and `Footer` to `frontend/src/index.css`.
    - **App Integration:** Integrated `Navbar` and `Footer` into `frontend/src/App.jsx` to ensure their presence across all pages.
    - **Redundant Link Removal:** Removed duplicate navigation links from `frontend/src/pages/Home.jsx`, `Signup.jsx`, `Login.jsx`, `VerifyEmail.jsx`, `ForgotPassword.jsx`, `ResetPasswordWithToken.jsx`, `ResendVerificationEmail.jsx`, `Logout.jsx`, `Profile.jsx`, `UpdateProfile.jsx`, `LoginHistory.jsx`, `ActiveSessions.jsx`, and `ResetPassword.jsx`.
- **Current Status:**
    - The frontend now features a unified navigation bar and footer, enhancing consistency and user experience.
    - Redundant navigation elements have been successfully removed from individual pages.
