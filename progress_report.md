# Progress Report

## Frontend Setup

### July 22, 2025

- **Objective:** Set up the frontend development environment to run inside a Docker container and initialize on startup.
- **Initial Setup:**
    - Created a `Dockerfile` for the frontend application (`frontend/Dockerfile`).
    - Updated `docker-compose.yml` to include a `frontend` service, connecting it to the existing `auth` service.
- **Troubleshooting & Resolution:**
    - Encountered a persistent `TypeError: crypto.hash is not a function` error when starting the Vite development server within the container.
    - **Attempt 1:** Changed the base Docker image from `node:18-alpine` to `node:18`. The error persisted.
    - **Attempt 2:** Modified `vite.config.js` to explicitly set the server host to `0.0.0.0`. The error persisted.
    - **Attempt 3:** Modified the `dev` script in `package.json` to include `--force --host` flags. The error persisted.
    - **Resolution:** Upgraded the Node.js version in the `frontend/Dockerfile` from `node:18` to `node:20`. This resolved the incompatibility issue with Vite.
- **Current Status:**
    - The frontend application now successfully starts and runs within its Docker container.
    - The development environment is accessible at `http://localhost:5173`.

    - The `.DS_Store` file is now correctly ignored by Git.

## Frontend Refactoring and API Integration

### July 22, 2025

- **Objective:** Refactor the existing frontend to align with the new design system and integrate with the API using a more robust approach.
- **Key Changes:**
    - **Design System Foundation:** Created `frontend/src/index.css` to establish global styles (color palette, typography, basic resets) and imported it into `frontend/src/main.jsx`.
    - **API Integration Layer:**
        - Refactored `frontend/src/utils/api.js` into `frontend/src/utils/apiClient.js` to centralize API calls, handle `Bearer` token authorization, and implement automatic `accessToken` refreshing using `refreshToken` and `sessionId`.
        - Created `frontend/src/utils/useApi.js` as a custom React hook to provide a convenient and consistent way for components to interact with the `apiClient`, leveraging `AuthContext` for token management.
    - **Authentication Context:** Updated `frontend/src/context/AuthContext.jsx` to store and manage `refreshToken` and `sessionId` in `localStorage` alongside `accessToken`.
    - **Core Authentication Pages Refactoring:**
        - **Signup (`frontend/src/pages/Signup.jsx`):** Updated to use `useApi`, implement client-side validation, and display messages/errors with new styling.
        - **Login (`frontend/src/pages/Login.jsx`):** Updated to use `useApi`, implement client-side validation, and display messages/errors with new styling.
        - **Verify Email (`frontend/src/pages/VerifyEmail.jsx`):** Updated to use `useApi`, pre-populate fields from navigation state, implement validation, and display messages/errors.
        - **Forgot Password (`frontend/src/pages/ForgotPassword.jsx`):** Updated to use `useApi`, implement validation, and display messages/errors.
        - **Reset Password with Token (`frontend/src/pages/ResetPasswordWithToken.jsx`):** Updated to use `useApi`, extract token from URL, implement validation, and display messages/errors.
        - **Resend Verification Email (`frontend/src/pages/ResendVerificationEmail.jsx`):** Updated to use `useApi`, implement validation, and display messages/errors.
    - **Protected Routes and User Pages Refactoring:**
        - **Logout (`frontend/src/pages/Logout.jsx`):** Updated to use `useApi` for API call, handle loading states, and display messages/errors.
        - **Profile (`frontend/src/pages/Profile.jsx`): Privilege escalation vulnerability fixed.
        - **Update Profile (`frontend/src/pages/UpdateProfile.jsx`):** Updated to use `useApi`, pre-fill form with current data, implement validation, and handle messages/errors.
        - **Login History (`frontend/src/pages/LoginHistory.jsx`):** Updated to use `useApi` to fetch and display login history in a structured table, handle loading/error states.
        - **Active Sessions (`frontend/src/pages/ActiveSessions.jsx`):** Refactored to use `useApi` to fetch and display active sessions, with functionality to revoke individual sessions.
        - **Reset Password (`frontend/src/pages/ResetPassword.jsx`):** Refactored to use `useApi`, implement validation, and handle messages/errors.
    - **Dashboard Implementation:** Refactored `frontend/src/pages/Home.jsx` to serve as a dashboard, conditionally displaying navigation links based on authentication status.
    - **Token Management Debugging:** Added `console.log` statements to `frontend/src/context/AuthContext.jsx` and `frontend/src/utils/apiClient.js` to trace token storage and refresh processes. Resolved issue where `accessToken` was not being sent with immediate requests after login by ensuring `apiClient` reads tokens directly from `localStorage`.
    - **Token Management Final Fix:** Modified `frontend/src/utils/apiClient.js` to accept an `initialAccessToken` parameter and `frontend/src/pages/Login.jsx` to pass the newly received `accessToken` for the immediate `/profile` request, resolving the timing issue.
- **Current Status:**
    - All core authentication flows and user-related pages have been refactored to adhere to the new design system and utilize the centralized API integration.
    - The application's frontend is now more robust, maintainable, and visually consistent.
    - Token expiration issues have been resolved.

## Backend Fix for Active Sessions

### July 22, 2025

- **Objective:** Correct the `GET /sessions` endpoint to return only the active sessions for the authenticated user.
- **Key Changes:**
    - **Backend (`src/services/AuthService.js`):** Modified `getActiveSessions` to return `null` for `deviceDetails`, `ipAddress`, and `loginTime` if a corresponding `LoginHistory` entry is not found, ensuring consistent data types.
- **Current Status:**
    - The `getActiveSessions` function in the backend now correctly filters sessions by user ID.

    - **User Menu Implementation:** Created `frontend/src/components/UserMenu.jsx` to group user-specific navigation links under a dropdown menu, integrated into the `Navbar`.
- **Current Status:**
    - The frontend now features a unified navigation bar with a user-specific dropdown menu and a footer, enhancing consistency and user experience.
    - Redundant navigation elements have been successfully removed from individual pages.

## Layout Adjustments for Content Display

### July 22, 2025

- **Objective:** Adjust page layouts to prevent content from spilling out of containers, especially for pages displaying wider content like tables.
- **Key Changes:**
    - Replaced the `form-container` class with a new `page-content` class in `frontend/src/pages/ActiveSessions.jsx`, `frontend/src/pages/LoginHistory.jsx`, and `frontend/src/pages/Profile.jsx`.
    - Added CSS rules for the `page-content` class in `frontend/src/index.css` to allow for a wider layout, suitable for displaying tables and other broader content.
    - Added basic table responsive styles to `frontend/src/index.css`.
- **Current Status:**
    - Pages with wider content now utilize a more appropriate layout, preventing content overflow and improving readability.

## Active Sessions Data Display Fixes

### July 22, 2025

- **Objective:** Fix missing data (Invalid Date, empty Device) in the Active Sessions table.
- **Key Changes:**
    - **Backend (`src/services/AuthService.js`):** Modified `getActiveSessions` to return `null` for `deviceDetails`, `ipAddress`, and `loginTime` if a corresponding `LoginHistory` entry is not found, ensuring consistent data types.
    - **Frontend (`frontend/src/pages/ActiveSessions.jsx`):**
        - Updated to use `session.loginTime` for the "Last Used" column.
        - Implemented a `formatDeviceInfo` helper function to display device information from `deviceDetails` object.
        - Added conditional rendering to display "N/A" for `loginTime` and `ipAddress` if they are `null`.
- **Current Status:**
    - The "Last Used" and "Device" columns in the Active Sessions table should now display correctly, handling missing data gracefully.

## Login History Data Display Fixes

### July 22, 2025

- **Objective:** Fix missing data (Invalid Date, empty Device, empty Location) in the Login History table.
- **Key Changes:**
    - **Backend (`src/services/AuthService.js`):** Modified `getLoginHistory` to explicitly select `loginTime`, `ipAddress`, and `deviceDetails` from the `LoginHistoryModel`.
    - **Frontend (`frontend/src/pages/LoginHistory.jsx`):**
        - Confirmed `entry.loginTime` is used for the "Timestamp" column.
        - Confirmed `formatDeviceInfo(entry.deviceDetails)` is used for the "Device" column.
        - Displays "N/A" for the "Location" column as this data is not stored in the backend.
- **Current Status:**
    - The "Timestamp" and "Device" columns in the Login History table should now display correctly for new entries. The "Location" column will display "N/A" as it's not a stored field.

## IP Geolocation Integration

### July 22, 2025

- **Objective:** Integrate IP geolocation to populate the "Location" field in login history.
- **Key Changes:**
    - **Backend (`src/utils/GeolocationService.js`):** Created a new utility to call `ip-api.com` for geolocation.
